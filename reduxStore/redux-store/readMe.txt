So after I received this project from you, I sat alone to research how to work with redux 
because it's the only thing we didn't get to practice much in the course I studied.
That's why I'm very satisfied with the result - a project that includes a client side that forwards requests to the local server I created,
and it forwards an http request to pixabay's api and displays the resulting images the way you wanted.
During the project I used the console.log a lot to overcome errors and also so that I and the reader would understand better,
but despite this, I deleted the entire console.log so that the project would be cleaner.
If you want, I can add the comments that explain the various functions and values ​​in the project, and of course explain verbally.


It was a fun project.
Looking forward to seeing you
